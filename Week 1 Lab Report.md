After downloading git, follow [these steps](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50527994) to set the default terminal on VS Code to git bash. On the git bash terminal, run the command "ssh [account name]@ieng6.ucsd.edu". Type "yes" to continue connecting and then type your password when prompted. Afterwards, the terminal should display this: ![Image](https://github.com/clarencechow/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/connecting_screenshot.png?raw=true)
